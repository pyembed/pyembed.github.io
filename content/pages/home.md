[TOC]

PyEmbed is a Python library that allows you to easily embed content on your website from a wide variety of sources (including [Flickr](http://flickr.com/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and [YouTube](http://youtube.com/)).  It uses the [oEmbed](http://www.oembed.com/) standard to discover how to represent the resource on your website.

## Key features ##

- Zero configuration - just supply the URL that you want to embed content from.
- Support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
- Works with static site generators, including [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com).

## Getting started ##

If you want to use PyEmbed with Markdown, follow the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

If you're interested in using PyEmbed within your own project, then you can install the core library using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/).
