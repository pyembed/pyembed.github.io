PyEmbed is a Python library that allows you to easily embed content on your website from a wide variety of sources (including [Flickr](http://flickr.com/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and [YouTube](http://youtube.com/)).

- Works with static site generators, including [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com).
- Fully customizable embeddings, with support for [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
